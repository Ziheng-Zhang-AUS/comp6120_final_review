## Software Engineering

**Software engineering** is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.

A **software development** process organizes activity into distinct phases (e.g. design, coding, testing, etc.). Processes can increase efficiency, but are often implemented poorly.

Effort estimation is based on historical information (models, experience). It is complicated by uncertainty, which stems from risk, which can be managed(identified, minimized).
